# aura: project guide

Mobile-first web app that helps friend groups find and meet other friend groups (Team Aura class project). See README.md for setup and the vertical-slice demo.

Machine-specific notes (paths, accounts, local setup) belong in `CLAUDE.local.md`, which is git-ignored. Never put them here.

## Stack
- `client/`: React 19 + Vite 7, plain CSS (`client/src/styles.css` holds the design tokens). Hash routes: `#/find`, `#/messages`, `#/messages/:chatId`, `#/profile`. There is no Map tab; it's out of scope.
- `server/`: Node + Express 5 REST API. It talks to Postgres with `pg` only. Don't add the Supabase JS client.
- `db/`: `schema.sql` (drops and recreates everything) and `seed.sql` (truncates, then inserts demo data).
- `docs/`: ERD as `erd.dbml`, `erd.mmd` and `erd.png` (`npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i docs/erd.mmd -o docs/erd.png`).
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci && npm run build` on every PR; merge only through PRs (README "How We Merge").
- Hosting: Render, from `render.yaml` (API web service + static client). The client reads `VITE_API_URL` at build time; the API allows only `CORS_ORIGIN`. Pushing to `main` redeploys.
- Database: the shared Supabase project **Find Friends App**, reached through the Session pooler (port 5432). The connection string lives only in `server/.env`.
- Profile photos: Supabase Storage, public bucket `profile-photos`, called over its REST API with `fetch` in `server/src/lib/storage.js` (still no Supabase JS client). Needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (plus the `SUPABASE_URL` sign-in already uses) in `server/.env` and on Render; the service_role key never goes to the client.
- AI: the API calls Google's Gemini API to write 3 conversation starters for each new match. `server/src/lib/gemini.js` is the only file that talks to it (plain `fetch`, no SDK); `server/src/lib/suggestions.js` has the prompt, the checks on the answer and the `chat_suggestions` queries. The key is `GEMINI_API_KEY`, read from the API's environment (Render's Environment tab, or `server/.env`); `GEMINI_MODEL` overrides the model.

## Commands (run from the repo root)
- `npm install`: installs both workspaces.
- `npm run dev`: starts the API (`API_PORT`, default 4000) and Vite (5173, which proxies `/api` to the API).
- `npm run db:check`: connects with `server/.env` and prints the `users` row count. It's read-only.
- `npm run db:reset`: runs schema then seed. **This wipes the shared team database.** Ask the team (or the user) before running it.
- `npm run db:demo-accounts`: creates a demo login (Supabase Auth, `<first name>@example.com`) for each of the 16 seeded users and links it. It needs `DEMO_PASSWORD` in `server/.env`, and it's safe to re-run; run it again after `db:reset`, which unlinks them. The `auth.users` foreign key can only be added by the `postgres` login, so `schema.sql` and migration 003 skip it with a warning when run as `aura_app`.
- `npm run db:migrate`: runs every `db/migrations/*.sql` (re-runnable) and prints the OKR percentages. It keeps everyone's data except what a migration deliberately removes (002 drops the old events tables).
- The `verify:*` scripts sign in as the demo accounts (`server/scripts/lib/session.js`), so they need `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `DEMO_PASSWORD` in `server/.env`.
- `npm run verify:slice`: end-to-end check of the Accept flow. It mutates data, so follow it with `db:reset` only if the team agrees.
- `npm run verify:chat`: end-to-end check of live chat updates (`?after=` polling, list re-sort). It posts a real message and marks a chat read, so ask the team before running it on the shared database, and follow it with `db:reset` only if the team agrees.
- `npm run verify:messages`: checks that bad messages (empty, whitespace or invisible only, `\u0000`, too long, not text) get `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` and save nothing. It's read-only and safe on the shared database; `-- --post` also saves two test messages.
- `npm run verify:receipts`: end-to-end check of read receipts. It posts a real message and marks a chat read for two people, so the same rules as `verify:chat` apply on the shared database.
- `npm run verify:typing`: end-to-end check of the typing indicator (ping, poll, clear, 5s expiry, 403/404). It posts one real message and marks a chat read, so the same rules as `verify:chat` apply on the shared database.
- `npm run verify:own-groups`: checks that Find and "Groups that liked you" never offer a person their own group. Leaves the data as it was.
- `npm run verify:suggestions`: end-to-end check of the AI conversation starters (Accept doesn't wait for the AI, 3 rows saved, `used_at` on send, none once both groups have chatted; the fallback if the API has no key). It accepts a real request and posts two messages, so the same rules as `verify:slice` apply on the shared database. `-- --ai` only asks the AI for starters and prints them: it saves nothing and needs no demo login, so it's safe on the shared database, but it needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `server/.env` and uses one Gemini request.
- `npm run build`: production build of the client.

## Conventions
- API errors are always `{ error: { code, message, details? } }` with codes like `GROUP_FULL`, `NO_GROUP`, `NOT_ACTIVE_GROUP`. Database trigger errors (`AU001`, `AU002`) are mapped in `server/src/errors.js`.
- Auth is Supabase Auth (email + password). The client (`client/src/supabase.js`, `@supabase/auth-js` only) sends `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`. `authenticate` in `server/src/middleware/auth.js` verifies it against Supabase's public keys (`SUPABASE_URL`) and returns `401` otherwise. `identify` then loads the `users` row by `auth_user_id` (`403 NO_PROFILE` if none). Only `/api/health` and `/api/interests` are public. Don't bring back an `X-User-Id` path or a public user list.
- Find has labeled **Pass** / **Connect** buttons; swiping the card (`components/SwipeCard.jsx`, touch only) is just a shortcut. The first visit opens `components/FindExplainer.jsx` once per browser (`localStorage` `aura.findExplainerSeen`). Keep copy clear that Connect is for the active group and doesn't mean joining the other group.
- Find, likes, the incoming-likes inbox and the chat list always act as the user's **active group** (`actingGroupId` in `server/src/middleware/auth.js`).
- Anything that has to be atomic goes through `withTransaction` (`server/src/db.js`), for example `recordDecision` in `server/src/lib/matching.js`.
- The JSON the API returns is camelCase; database columns are snake_case.
- UI: inline stroke SVG icons (`components/Icon.jsx`), no emoji, avatars: a person's main photo (`user_photos.position = 1`, sent as `photoUrl`) or, without one, their illustrated DiceBear avatar (`Avatar src={p.photoUrl} personId={p.id}`; `client/src/illustrated.js`), with `alt=""` because the name is always beside it; groups use initials on pastel, touch targets of at least 44px. Every real photo gets alt text naming the person; placeholders use `role="img"` with an `aria-label` instead of reading "[Photo 1]". Long names must wrap (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`) or shorten with an ellipsis, never overflow.
- Loading states come from `components/Loading.jsx`: `Skeleton` rows built from the real rows' classes where the layout is known, otherwise `Loader` (spinner and label). Mark the loading area `aria-busy="true"` and pair skeletons with a `LoadingStatus` (`role="status"`). The global `prefers-reduced-motion` rule in `styles.css` stops every animation.
- Layout: below 1024px wide it's the phone layout (430px column, bottom tab bar). At 1024px and up, `App.jsx` (`useMediaQuery`) switches to the desktop layout: a sidebar (`SideNav`), Messages as list + chat panes, Find card side by side, and Profile in two columns. All desktop CSS lives in the `min-width: 1024px` blocks at the end of `styles.css`. Keep phone styles outside those blocks.
- Schema changes go in `db/schema.sql` (and the ERD files), never only by hand in the Supabase dashboard. To change the live shared database without wiping it, also add a re-runnable file in `db/migrations/` and run `npm run db:migrate`.
- OKRs (KR1-KR4) come from the `okr_metrics` view; README "OKR Metrics" says which table each one reads.
- AI calls never run inside a request or a transaction, and nothing may depend on one succeeding: `queueSuggestions` starts the call after the match is committed and returns at once, and every failure (no key, timeout, bad answer) just means no openers. Whatever the model returns is checked (`readStarters`) before it's saved or shown. Send it group-level data only (names, cities, interests), never member names or messages.

## Business rules (enforced on the server or in the database)
- A Friend Group has at most 10 members (trigger `group_member_cap`, which raises `GROUP_FULL`). A chat has at most 30 people (`chat_participant_cap`, which raises `CHAT_FULL`).
- Only a group's owner can change its photo (`PUT`/`DELETE /groups/:id/photo`, `friend_groups.photo_url`).
- A person has 1 main photo (position 1) + up to 3 more (positions 2-4). The first photo becomes main; `POST /me/photos/:id/main` swaps; deleting closes the gap.
- A user can be in several groups but has one active group, which must be one of their own groups (composite FK `users_active_group_is_membership`).
- A group's shared interests are the union of its members' interests, computed by the `group_shared_interests` view and never stored.
- Two groups match when each group has a `connect` row in `group_likes` toward the other. The match, its chat and all members of both groups as participants are created in one transaction.
- Recommendations are ranked by shared interests, then 1st-degree mutual friends, then 2nd-degree, then same city, then distance. They exclude your own groups and any group the active group has already liked, passed on or matched with. "Groups that liked you" also hides requests from any other group the viewer is in (they couldn't answer them: `OWN_GROUP`).
- Onboarding gate: the app is unusable without a group (`403 NO_GROUP`). Creating or joining a group requires a complete profile (`403 PROFILE_INCOMPLETE`).
- A new match's chat gets 3 AI conversation starters in `chat_suggestions` (or none if the AI call fails). The chat offers the unused ones (`used_at IS NULL`) to both groups until someone from each group has sent a message, the same "both groups have talked" as KR3. Sending a message with `suggestionId` sets that row's `used_at`.

## Secrets
- Never commit `server/.env`, real passwords, full connection strings or API keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`). `server/.env.example` only has placeholders. Never log a key or put it in a URL.
- `.claude/` (local Claude Code settings) and `CLAUDE.local.md` are git-ignored.
